## Description

The **goal** is to match all the cards with their respective pairs. 
In this version of the game a **timer** and a **star rating** functionality have been added to encourage player implication. 
To that end as well, a pop-up **modal** shows up at the end of each game to give feedback and congratulate the player. 

## Instructions

The game starts when the player clicks on a card. Then, the timer starts and the amount of moves (two clicks are one move) is monitored in order to rate the memory and/or performance of the player. The more moves the player makes, the fewer stars they get.
When all cards have been matched the game ends. Finally, a modal appears with the information of the game (moves, star rating and time) and asks the player if they want to play again.

## Features

- Responsive design across all screens and devices
